The intention of the repo is to help the user understand methodology on how to query for information you need. While the examples I have given is for Splunk.. you can apply the same methodology and thinking to just about any tool you use. Though... in order to understand methodology you have to understand the fundamentals of the operating system (I'm still working on that) as well as network just because it all plays off that. It's like trying to hunt for threats in the house when you don't know what the structure of the house is and how it operates. The noise of water running all day could be considered somebody broke into the house when you forgot to turn off the faucet. Something to consider when you're learning IT/Cyber.
